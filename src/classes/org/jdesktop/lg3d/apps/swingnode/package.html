  This is a simple test of the SwingNode infrastructure. The demo maps 
  a swing panel onto a simple cloth simulation. The cloth is blowing in
  the wind. Even as the cloth deforms you can still interact with the 
  JPanel components.
  
  This simply demonstrates that we can map the Swing JPanel onto an 
  arbritrary shape, it's not meant to be a usable example.
